# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

> This repo contains Labs done as assignments for course 6 of 6 in the Google IT Automation with Python Specialization.

- Week 1
> Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they've hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90Â° and too large. Oof! You're not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

> Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:
> - Open an image
> - Rotate an image
> - Resize an image
> - Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory.

- Week 2  
> You're working at a company that sells second-hand cars. Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company's website. To do this, you'll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company's website (currently using Django).

> - Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files
> - Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
> - Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
> - Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
